# DCDFT
## Date-compensated Discrete Fourier Transfrom

The unevenness in the spacing between consecutive dates and the small size of the series makes use of the techniques normally used for uniformly spaced time series (e.g. annual crops, rainfall, etc.) very hazardous. Therefore a date-compensated technique must be adopted.
